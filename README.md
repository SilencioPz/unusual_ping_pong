<h1 align="center" style="font-size: 18px;">A simple ping-pong game, using Java.</h1>

    This is part of the knowledge I acquire studying with John of Cave Programming at Udemy.

    It's important to notice that: there's no extreme work about the collisions and all physics because it's a test. I wanted to see how the game works and what it's like to research and practice in a game. Must say, not a pleasant task. Very difficult and you must know a lot about physics, distance, time, the mentioned collision, reflection, and much more. Anyway, I can work on it in the future, who knows?! :)
